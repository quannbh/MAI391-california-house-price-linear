# California House Price Prediction Engine


## 1. Introduction:
This open source project belongs to a subject at **FPT University** called **Mathematics for Machine Learning**. This project is a non-profit project that predicts the average value of each house in the state of **California, USA**. This dataset has not been verified by us for authenticity, the dataset is taken from a public dataset at Kaggle and has been preprocessed by our team before being used on the model. **Because of its low authenticity, this model and dataset are only in the laboratory and not deployed in practice. We recommend that you use them only as a further reference to better understand Linear Regression and ways to process and visualize data.**

## 2. Techstack:
This source project was built entirely on **Jupyter Notebook** by our team, because of its ease of visualization and working with data. Additionally, we also use **Python 3.10.9** and **Scikit-learn library** in this project. Some packages that need to be installed will soon be updated in file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), try clone the repo and play with it. Additionally, you can also rebuild the model based on your data to see what the magic of **Linear Regression** can do.
